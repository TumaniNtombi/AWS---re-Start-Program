# AWS Monitoring & Management Notes

## 1. Overview

Monitoring and management in AWS is crucial to **ensure system reliability, performance, and cost efficiency**. AWS provides tools to monitor cloud resources, manage operations, and optimize costs. This helps organizations maintain **high availability, security, and operational excellence**.

Key Goals:
- Track resource usage and performance  
- Identify and troubleshoot issues quickly  
- Optimize operational costs and forecast spending  
- Maintain compliance and security

## 2. Monitoring Tools

### **2.1 Amazon CloudWatch**
CloudWatch is the primary monitoring service for AWS resources.

**Key Features:**
- **Metrics Collection:** CPU, memory, disk, network for EC2, RDS, Lambda, and more  
- **Alarms:** Trigger notifications or actions when metrics breach thresholds  
- **Logs:** Collect and monitor logs from AWS services and applications  
- **Dashboards:** Create custom dashboards for visualization of metrics  

**Use Cases:**
- Monitor application performance  
- Detect anomalies or resource saturation  
- Trigger Auto Scaling or Lambda functions automatically

### **2.2 AWS CloudTrail**
CloudTrail enables **governance, compliance, and auditing** by logging API calls and user activity.

**Key Features:**
- Records AWS API calls across services  
- Tracks user and role activity  
- Integrates with CloudWatch for alerting  

**Use Cases:**
- Security auditing  
- Troubleshooting operational issues  
- Compliance reporting

### **2.3 AWS Trusted Advisor**
Trusted Advisor provides **real-time guidance to optimize AWS resources** based on best practices.

**Categories:**
1. **Cost Optimization:** Identify unused or underutilized resources  
2. **Security:** Enable encryption, remove overly permissive access  
3. **Fault Tolerance:** Recommend Multi-AZ deployments, backup strategies  
4. **Performance:** Improve latency and throughput  
5. **Service Limits:** Monitor resource quotas to prevent disruptions  

**Example:** Trusted Advisor may suggest resizing EC2 instances or deleting unattached EBS volumes to save costs.

## 3. Management Tools

### **3.1 AWS Systems Manager (SSM)**
SSM helps **manage and automate operational tasks** across AWS resources.

**Key Features:**
- **Run Command:** Execute commands on multiple EC2 instances  
- **Automation:** Automate common maintenance and deployment tasks  
- **Patch Manager:** Apply OS patches automatically  
- **Inventory:** Track software and configuration details across resources  

**Use Cases:**
- Consistent management of EC2 instances and hybrid environments  
- Automating repetitive operations tasks  

---

### **3.2 AWS Config**
Config monitors and **records AWS resource configurations** for compliance and auditing.

**Features:**
- Tracks changes to resource configurations  
- Provides a historical view of configuration changes  
- Rules engine to enforce compliance  

**Use Cases:**
- Audit resource configurations  
- Enforce corporate or regulatory policies

## 4. Cost Management & Billing

### **4.1 AWS Cost Explorer**
Cost Explorer helps **visualize and analyze AWS spending**.

**Features:**
- View historical cost and usage trends  
- Filter by service, account, region, and tags  
- Forecast future costs based on past usage  

**Example:** Identify cost spikes in EC2 or S3 usage and take corrective actions.

### **4.2 AWS Budgets**
Budgets allow **setting custom cost and usage thresholds**.

**Features:**
- Track actual or forecasted cost against budgets  
- Receive notifications when exceeding thresholds  
- Supports multiple budget types: cost, usage, and reservation  

**Use Cases:**
- Control monthly spending  
- Optimize resource allocation  

---

### **4.3 AWS Billing Dashboard**
The Billing Dashboard provides **an overview of account charges, usage, and payment history**.
