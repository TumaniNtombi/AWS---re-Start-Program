# 🗂️ SQL Lab – Database and Table Management

## 🎯 Objective
In this lab, I practice fundamental SQL statements for managing databases and tables.  

By the end of this lab, I should be able to:  
- Use the `CREATE` statement to create databases and tables  
- Use the `SHOW` statement to view available databases and tables  
- Use the `ALTER` statement to alter the structure of a table  
- Use the `DROP` statement to delete databases and tables  

When starting this lab, I assume the MySQL environment is already set up and ready.
