üóÑÔ∏è Database Lab ‚Äì SQL Basics

In this lab, I demonstrate working with databases, tables, columns, rows, and conditions.

By the end of this lab, I was able to:
Use the CREATE statement to create databases and tables
Use the INSERT statement to add data into a table
Use the SELECT statement to query data
Use conditions in queries
Understand how rows and columns are structured

-- Create a new database
CREATE DATABASE world;

-- Switch to the database
USE world;

-- Create a table named 'Country'
CREATE TABLE Country (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    continent VARCHAR(50),
    population INT
);
