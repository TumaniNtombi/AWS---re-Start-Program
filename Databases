# AWS Database Notes

## 1. Overview

AWS offers a wide range of database services to store, manage, and analyze both structured and unstructured data. Choosing the right database depends on factors like:

- **Data type** (relational, key-value, document, graph, in-memory)  
- **Scale** (small projects vs enterprise workloads)  
- **Access patterns** (read-heavy, write-heavy, or mixed workloads)  
- **Latency and availability requirements**  

**Key benefits of AWS Databases:**

- **Fully managed:** AWS handles setup, patching, backups, scaling, and maintenance.  
- **Scalable:** Storage and compute resources grow or shrink automatically.  
- **Highly available:** Multi-AZ deployments and replication ensure minimal downtime.  
- **Secure:** IAM integration, encryption at rest/in transit, fine-grained access control.  
- **Integrated:** Works seamlessly with AWS compute, analytics, and storage services.

## 2. Main Services

### **[Amazon RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/)**
- **Type:** Managed relational (SQL) database  
- **Supported engines:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQL Server, Amazon Aurora  
- **Use cases:** Web apps, e-commerce, ERP systems, transactional workloads  

**Key Features:**

- Automated backups & point-in-time recovery  
- Multi-AZ deployments for high availability  
- Read replicas to offload read-heavy workloads  
- Performance monitoring via CloudWatch  

**Example:** Host a MySQL database for an e-commerce site with automated backups and high availability.

---

### **[Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)**
- **Type:** Fully managed NoSQL database (key-value & document)  
- **Use cases:** Real-time apps, IoT, mobile apps, gaming leaderboards, session management  

**Key Features:**

- Serverless scaling of throughput & storage  
- Single-digit millisecond response times  
- Global tables for multi-region replication  
- Fine-grained access control via IAM  

**Example:** Store user session data for a mobile app, automatically scaling for spikes.

---

### **[Amazon Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/)**
- **Type:** High-performance MySQL/PostgreSQL-compatible relational DB  
- **Use cases:** Enterprise applications needing high throughput, low latency, high availability  

**Key Features:**

- Up to 5x faster than standard MySQL  
- Fault-tolerant & self-healing (continuous S3 backups)  
- Auto-scaling storage  
- Multiple read replicas across regions  

**Example:** Mission-critical web app requiring near-zero downtime.

### **Other AWS Database Services**

- **[Amazon ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/):** In-memory caching for Redis/Memcached  
- **[Amazon Neptune](https://aws.amazon.com/neptune/):** Graph database for relationship-heavy datasets  
- **[Amazon DocumentDB](https://aws.amazon.com/documentdb/):** Managed document DB compatible with MongoDB  
- **[Amazon Keyspaces](https://aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/):** Managed Cassandra-compatible DB

## 3. Key Concepts

### **Backup & Restore**
- Automated backups for recoverability  
- Snapshots: point-in-time copies of DB  
- Point-in-time recovery within retention period  

### **Replication**
- Multi-AZ deployment: standby replica in another Availability Zone  
- Read replicas: offload read traffic  

### **Scaling**
- Vertical scaling: increase instance size (CPU, RAM, IOPS)  
- Horizontal scaling: add read replicas for read-heavy workloads  
- Serverless scaling (Aurora Serverless): adjusts compute automatically

## 4. Best Practices

1. Enable automated backups for recoverability  
2. Use Multi-AZ deployments in production  
3. Monitor performance via CloudWatch (CPU, memory, connections, IOPS)  
4. Encrypt sensitive data at rest with KMS & in transit with SSL/TLS  
5. Use IAM roles & policies for secure access  
6. Implement read replicas for read-heavy workloads  
7. Regularly test recovery plans  
8. Optimize queries & indexing for performance  
9. Leverage serverless or on-demand options to save costs  
10. Integrate with analytics services like Athena or Redshift for insights
